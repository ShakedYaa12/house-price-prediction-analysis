# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. The dataset used includes house sales data with detailed information on each property, allowing for in-depth analysis and modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset contains several features, including:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the house
- `date`: Date of sale
- `price`: Price of the house
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `sqft_living`: Square footage of the living space
- `sqft_lot`: Size of the lot
- `floors`: Number of floors
- `waterfront`: Whether the house has a waterfront view
- And many more.

The dataset is stored in the `house_data.csv` file, and you can find a detailed description of each feature in the notebook.

## Analysis and Modeling
In this project, we:
1. Explored the dataset and performed data cleaning, removing missing or incorrect values.
2. Visualized relationships between different features and house prices to gain insights.
3. Used machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, to predict house prices based on the features.
4. Evaluated the model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

## Key Insights
- There is a strong correlation between house size (sqft_living) and price.
- Waterfront properties generally command higher prices.
- Number of bathrooms and floors also have a noticeable impact on house prices.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python** for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for implementing machine learning models.

## Future Work
- Implement more advanced machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.
- Add more features or external data, such as neighborhood details, to enhance the model.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a demonstration of my early skills in data analysis and machine learning. It shows my ability to handle a real-world dataset, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance. Over time, I plan to improve and optimize this project further as I continue to develop my skills.
